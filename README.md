# GEO IP
                                              
GEO IP is bash script which will help you to get information about IP.
The script is based on ipgeolocation.io API so you need own, you can get it for free on their site.
To view JSON I use **jq**, *script will automatic download it*.

You can get script in two versions
  > root version - if you don't have jq installed
  > 
  > no root version - if you have jq installed
